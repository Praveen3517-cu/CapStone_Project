### **Project Summary**

#### **Project Title**:  
**Automated Cybersecurity News Scraper and Database Integration**

---

#### **Concept**:  
The project aims to automate the collection of cybersecurity-related news and advisories from multiple sources, store the data in a structured format (JSON), and integrate it into a MongoDB database for further analysis or reporting. The system uses web scraping techniques with **Selenium** and **Playwright** for dynamic websites and **BeautifulSoup** for static content. The scraped data is then processed, cleaned, and stored in a MongoDB database for easy retrieval and analysis.

---

### **Key Features**:
1. **Web Scraping**:
   - Scrapes cybersecurity news and advisories from multiple websites (e.g., Times of India, Cyware, NCI-IPC).
   - Handles dynamic content using **Selenium** and **Playwright**.
   - Extracts structured data (title, description, link, date, CVE IDs).

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Saves scraped data in **JSON files** for local storage.
   - Integrates with **MongoDB** for centralized and scalable data storage.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Robust error handling for network issues, missing elements, and database connectivity.

4. **Automation**:
   - Fully automated workflow from scraping to database integration.
   - Can be scheduled to run periodically (e.g., using cron jobs).

- **Purpose**: Scrapes cybersecurity news articles from the Times of India website.
- **Technologies**: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pymongo`.
- **Key Features**:
  - Extracts article titles, summaries, links, and publication dates.
  - Parses and standardizes dates using `dateutil`.
  - Saves data to MongoDB and a JSON file.
- **Code Flow**:
  1. Fetch the webpage using `requests`.
  2. Parse HTML using `BeautifulSoup`.
  3. Extract and clean data.
  4. Save to MongoDB and JSON.

#### **2. Cyware Scraper**:
- **Purpose**: Scrapes cybersecurity advisories from the Cyware website.
- **Technologies**: `playwright`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pymongo`.
- **Key Features**:
  - Handles dynamic content using **Playwright**.
  - Extracts titles, summaries, links, and dates.
  - Uses **MongoDB upsert** to avoid duplicate entries.
- **Code Flow**:
  1. Launch a headless browser using **Playwright**.
  2. Navigate to the target URL and wait for content to load.
  3. Extract and clean data.
  4. Save to MongoDB and JSON.

#### **3. NCI-IPC Scraper**:
- **Purpose**: Scrapes cybersecurity advisories from the National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCI-IPC) website.
- **Technologies**: `selenium`, `pymongo`, `re`.
- **Key Features**:
  - Extracts advisory titles, descriptions, links, CVE IDs, and dates.
  - Uses **Selenium** to handle dynamic content.
  - Saves data to MongoDB and a JSON file.
- **Code Flow**:
  1. Launch a headless Chrome browser using **Selenium**.
  2. Navigate to the target URL and wait for content to load.
  3. Extract and clean data.
  4. Save to MongoDB and JSON.

### **How the Codes Work Together**:
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Each scraper targets a specific website and extracts relevant cybersecurity news/advisories.
   - The scrapers handle both static and dynamic content using appropriate tools (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, `Playwright`).

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Extracted data is cleaned and standardized (e.g., date parsing, CVE ID extraction).
   - Data is stored in a structured format (JSON) for local backup.

3. **Data Storage**:
   - All scrapers integrate with a centralized **MongoDB database**.
   - Data is stored in separate collections (e.g., `toi_news`, `cyware_news`, `nciipc_advisories`).

4. **Automation**:
   - The scrapers can be scheduled to run periodically (e.g., daily) to keep the database updated.

---

### **Key Benefits**:
1. **Efficiency**:
   - Automates the manual process of collecting cybersecurity news and advisories.
2. **Scalability**:
   - Can be extended to scrape additional websites or data sources.
3. **Centralized Storage**:
   - All data is stored in a MongoDB database for easy querying and analysis.
4. **Error Resilience**:
   - Robust error handling ensures the system can recover from failures.

---

### **Future Enhancements**:
1. **Add More Data Sources**:
   - Integrate additional cybersecurity news websites or RSS feeds.
2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Perform sentiment analysis or trend analysis on the collected data.
3. **Dashboard**:
   - Build a web-based dashboard to visualize the data (e.g., using Flask/Django and Plotly).
4. **Notifications**:
   - Send email or Slack notifications for new advisories or critical vulnerabilities.
